# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**! 🎉  
This repository is a structured collection of exercises, problems, and small projects designed to strengthen my JavaScript skills, from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific area of JavaScript:

| Folder                 | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `basic-js`             | Contains beginner-level exercises covering console methods, arithmetic, variables, and simple logic. Check its `README.md` for all 1–10 questions. |
| `variables-data-types` | Focuses on variables, constants, and data types. See its `README.md` for questions 11–20.                                                          |
| `loops`                | Includes exercises on `for`, `while`, `do...while`, nested loops, and iterating over strings/arrays/objects (questions 21–30).                     |
| `arrays`               | Covers array operations, manipulation, and methods (questions 31–40).                                                                              |
| `functions`            | Contains exercises to practice defining and using functions, performing calculations, and string/array manipulations (questions 41–50).            |

> **Note:** Each folder has its own `README.md` listing all practice questions in that section.
