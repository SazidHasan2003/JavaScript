# Basic DOM Manipulation Practice

This folder contains my JavaScript practice focused on **basic DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation**.  
The exercises are designed to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements and responds to user actions.

## Topics Covered

- Selecting DOM elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.)
- Modifying text content and attributes
- Changing styles dynamically using JavaScript
- Handling basic user events (click, input, etc.)
- Creating and removing elements dynamically
- Simple interactive behaviors using vanilla JavaScript

## Notes

The practice in this folder is implementation-based and does not follow a fixed list of questions.  
Each file represents hands-on experimentation and small tasks to understand DOM behavior.

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

- Build confidence working with the DOM
- Understand how JavaScript controls web page behavior
- Practice writing clean, interactive client-side code

This folder is part of my ongoing **JavaScript learning and practice journey**.
