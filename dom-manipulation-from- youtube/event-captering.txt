When you click on something (like a button), the browser handles that click in two simple steps:

Step 1: Going Down (Capturing)

The click starts from the top of the page and goes down to the element you clicked.

Step 2: Going Up (Bubbling)

After reaching the clicked element, the click then goes up to its parent elements.

👉 First it goes down, then it goes up.
