# Basic Data Structure & Logic Practice

This folder contains my JavaScript practice focused on **basic data structures and logic-building problems**.  
The exercises are implementation-based and cover core programming concepts commonly used in problem solving.

## Topics Covered

- Basic logic problems
- Conditional statements
- Loop-based problems
- Pattern printing using loops
- Array-based data structure operations

## Notes

The practice in this folder is based on hands-on implementation rather than a fixed set of written questions.  
Each JavaScript file represents individual logic or data structure exercises created during practice.

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to strengthen:

- Logical thinking
- Control flow understanding
- Loop and condition mastery
- Array-based data structure concepts

This folder is part of my **JavaScript learning and practice journey**.
